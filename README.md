# TypeScript Learning Reminder

This project provides a simple Node.js script to schedule daily reminders for learning TypeScript. It uses the `node-schedule` module to schedule the reminder and the `node-notifier` module to display visual notifications. Additionally, the script uses the `child_process` module to play a sound notification at the scheduled time.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your computer.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project folder in the terminal or command prompt.
3. Install the required packages by running the following command:

```bash
npm install node-schedule node-notifier
```

## Usage

1. Open the `reminder.js` file in a text editor.
2. Modify the following variables to suit your preferences:
   - `reminderTime`: Set your preferred learning time in 24-hour format (e.g., `'12:10'` for 12:10 PM).
   - `audioFile`: Replace `'/path/to/your/audio/file.mp3'` with the actual path to your desired audio file for the sound notification.
3. Save the changes to `reminder.js`.
4. Run the script using Node.js:

```bash
node reminder.js
```

## How it Works

1. The script schedules the daily reminder using `node-schedule`. It sets the time to the value specified in the `reminderTime` variable.

2. At the scheduled time, the script displays a visual notification using `node-notifier`. The notification includes the title "TypeScript Learning Reminder" and the message "Don't forget to learn TypeScript today!".

3. Simultaneously, the script plays a sound notification using the default audio player on your system. It does this by executing a command-line command to open the specified audio file.

## Customization

- You can adjust the `reminderTime` variable to set your preferred learning time.
- Replace the `audioFile` path with the actual path to your preferred audio file.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any issues with the sound notification, ensure that the `audioFile` path points to an accessible and valid audio file.
